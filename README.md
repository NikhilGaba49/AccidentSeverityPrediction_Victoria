# AccidentSeverityPrediction_Victoria
Research Question: To what extent are predetermined factors, including seat belt usage, age, road surface conditions, 
atmospheric conditions, node type, fuel and vehicle types, predictive of accident severity on Victorian roads? 

Project Description: In this investigation, we seek to investigate this research question using accidents stored in 
Victorian road crash data, by first preprocessing the chosen features, using correlation methods to investigate 
strong associations with accident severity and finally, evaluate the predictive power of the chosen features to predict
accident severity based off the historical accident data. The discussion of the methods chosen and limitations to the 
analysis is included in the project report.

To execute the code for operations and visualisations, please follow the steps:
1. Download the following datasets from "https://discover.data.vic.gov.au/dataset/victoria-road-crash-data":
- Accident
- Atmospheric Condition
- Person
- Node
- Road Surface Condition
2. Download the "filtered_vehicle.csv" from the zip file.
3. Upload all the .csv files to a folder in google drive named "a2-datasets"
4. Also upload the "EoDP_A2.ipynb" to a folder in google drive, 
named "Colab Notebooks".
5. Since the datasets and the code is now in google drive, the code can be executed by opening the notebook in Google Colaboratory, either manually from Google Drive or using "Open Colab" from Colab
6. Execute using Runtime -> Run all
